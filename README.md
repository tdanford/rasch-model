Description
-----------

A Rasch model is a generalized linear model, a type of item-response model 
in which the probability of a 'positive' output is distributed according to 
a logistic function of the 'skill' and 'difficulty' of the item and 
recipient, respectively.

This code is an experiment with building a hierarchical generalized
linear version of the Rasch model (a la Gelman) and then evaluating it 
through a sampler that uses slice-sampling as a sub-routine.
